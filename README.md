# BREAKOUT 

This is a DIKUGames repository fork for the 2024 Sofware Development at the University of Copenhagen, and the final codebase to be delivered for the exam.

The code in here has been written by:
+ Tobias Bjarnholt (`tcj841` or `swagtop` or `thedb`)
+ Freja Pia Nørager Seidler (`bfl942`)
+ Janus Jógvansson (`ktp367` or ` janus984 `)

To play the game, go to the /DIKUGames/Breakout/ directory, and run `dotnet run` in your terminal.
For debugging purposes, you can hit b to damage all blocks, and tab for skipping the current level.

To test the game, go to the /DIKUGames/BreakoutTests/ directory, and run `dotnet` to run the tests, or `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` to create a line/branch coverage analysis of the codebase.

We hope you enjoy!
